# Electric-Arm
This team is focused on creating an electric/motorized arm for a below-elbow amputee.

### Sub-teams
API is divided into three subteams: Production, Education, and Communication. Production designs and builds high-quality, affordable prosthetics using CAD modeling (Solidworks) and 3D printing. Production teaches amputees about disability resources and teaches middle/high school students about disability, prosthetics, and biomedical engineering. Lastly, Communication manages community outreach by connecting the club with amputee networks, hospitals, sponsors, and members. 

## Production Sub-teams 
Production is further divided into two sub-teams for the Electric arm: Design and Electrical. Design focus on the look and CAD of the Arm, while electrical deals with the electronics and programming of the arm.
